337	20	Student, Joint in History and Literature and Theater, Dance, Media at Harvard College	Woman	To prime me to associate either positive or negative feelings/words/emotions with Bob and then see how long it took me to respond when positive words were attached to Bob when I was primed to see Bob as a good person, when negative words were attached to Bob when I was primed to see Bob as a bad person, and also measure that it took me a longer time to react when the opposite feeling was attached to Bob; Like when I was primed to see Bob as a good person but I had to use the same key to select images of Bob and negative words	I wish it was less boring. I wish I had had the chance to listen to music while I was doing this study. Also, this computer is so old. I wish I had been able to adjust the monitor so I could more properly look at it. Lastly, I think you should be careful about how much easier it is to prime someone when they are clicking "c" for characteristic behavior and the monitor shows the word "correct" where as with "uncharacteristic behavior", there is either "correct"or "wrong" and neithe begins wih "u". Because "c" and "correct" both begin with "c",I think there is a level of priming happening that you cannot account for.
