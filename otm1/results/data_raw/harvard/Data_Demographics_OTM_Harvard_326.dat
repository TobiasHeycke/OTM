326	20	Psychology	Female	I do not know for sure, but think it may be related to speed and accuracy between trials when pressing the left and right keys for pictures of Bob and positive/negative words depending on whethr the learning exercise before gave the impresson tht Bob was eithergood or bad.	Using the 'c' and 'u' keys felt a bit Awkward, I think because they were not equidistant on the key board like the 'left' and 'right' keys were.
